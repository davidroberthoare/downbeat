- only use Framework7 library components and features whenever possible. Avoid custom CSS if it can be accomplished with an existing framework component.
- also use the framework7 icon set for all icons in the project. Do not use custom icons or icon libraries unless absolutely necessary.
- follow the framework7 design guidelines for layout, spacing, and typography to ensure a consistent look and feel across the app.
- leverage framework7's built-in responsive design features to ensure the app looks good on all screen sizes without needing custom media queries.
- utilize framework7's theming capabilities to force dark mode
- avoid using custom JavaScript for UI interactions that can be handled by framework7's components and features. This will help maintain consistency and reduce the amount of custom code needed.
- when implementing new features or UI elements, first check if there is a framework7 component that can be used or extended before creating custom solutions. This will help ensure that the app remains maintainable and consistent with the framework's design principles.
